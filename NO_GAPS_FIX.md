# 🔧 Fixed: Gaps Between Panels

## What Was Fixed

Removed gaps between panels to create a seamless 800×1080 layout.

## Changes Made

1. **Grid gap**: Set to `0`
2. **Panel borders**: Reduced from 2px to 1px
3. **Smart borders**: Removed double borders between adjacent panels
4. **Margins/Padding**: All set to 0

## Visual Result

### Before (with gaps):
```
┌───┐ ┌───┐
│ 1 │ │ 2 │  <- Gaps between panels
└───┘ └───┘
      
┌───┐ ┌───┐
│ 3 │ │ 4 │
└───┘ └───┘
```

### After (no gaps):
```
┌───┬───┐
│ 1 │ 2 │  <- Seamless connection
├───┼───┤
│ 3 │ 4 │
└───┴───┘
```

## Exact Layout

- Panel 1: 0,0 to 400,540
- Panel 2: 400,0 to 800,540  
- Panel 3: 0,540 to 400,1080
- Panel 4: 400,540 to 800,1080
- **Total**: Exactly 800×1080

## Options

### Current (minimal borders):
- 1px borders between panels
- Clean grid appearance
- No gaps

### Alternative (no borders):
To remove ALL borders, uncomment this CSS:
```css
.panel { border: none !important; }
.comic-grid { border: 2px solid #333; }
```

This gives you:
- Completely seamless panels
- Single outer border only
- Pure 800×1080 content

## Result

✅ No more gaps between panels
✅ Exact 800×1080 combined size
✅ Clean, professional appearance
