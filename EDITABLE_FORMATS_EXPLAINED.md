# 📝 Understanding Editable Formats

## The Reality About PDFs

**PDFs are NOT meant to be edited** like HTML. They're designed to be:
- Final, static documents
- Consistent across all devices
- Print-ready
- Read-only by nature

## Your Options for Editable Comics

### 1. **HTML = Your Editable Master File** 🌐

Think of it like:
- **HTML** = Photoshop .PSD file (editable)
- **PDF** = JPEG export (final output)

**How to use:**
1. Generate comic → Creates `page.html`
2. Open in browser → Edit freely
3. **Save the HTML file** to your computer
4. Open it anytime to continue editing
5. Export to PDF when you need to share

### 2. **Self-Contained HTML Package** 📦

I've created a special packager that creates a single HTML file with:
- All images embedded
- All editing features
- No external dependencies
- Can be shared and edited

```python
# Run this to create portable HTML
from backend.html_packager import create_portable_comic
create_portable_comic()
# Creates: output/comic_portable.html
```

### 3. **Online Comic Editor** 🔗

Keep your comic online:
- Access from anywhere
- Share editable link
- Always have latest version
- No files to manage

## Recommended Workflow

### For Personal Use:
1. Generate comic
2. Edit in browser
3. Bookmark the page
4. Export PDF when needed

### For Sharing Editable Version:
1. Generate comic
2. Create portable HTML
3. Share the HTML file
4. Recipients can edit in their browser

### For Final Distribution:
1. Complete all edits
2. Export to PDF
3. Share the PDF (not editable)

## Why This Approach?

1. **Best of both worlds**: Keep editability, export when needed
2. **No special software**: Just a web browser
3. **Version control**: Save multiple HTML versions
4. **Professional output**: PDF for final sharing

## The Bottom Line

- **PDF** = Final, non-editable output
- **HTML** = Your working, editable file
- **Portable HTML** = Shareable, editable file

Save your HTML files like you would save any document - they ARE your editable comics!
