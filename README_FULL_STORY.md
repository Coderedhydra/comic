# 📚 Full Story Comic Generation (10-15 Panels)

## 🎯 What's New

The comic generator now creates **full story comics** with 10-15 meaningful panels instead of just 4 panels. It intelligently analyzes your video's story and selects the most important moments.

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. **Story Analysis**
The system analyzes all subtitles/dialogue to identify:
- **Introduction**: Character introductions, scene setting
- **Conflict**: Problems, challenges, "but/however" moments  
- **Action**: Movement, battles, escapes
- **Emotions**: Joy, sadness, anger, fear
- **Climax**: Peak moments, critical turning points
- **Resolution**: Endings, conclusions, peace

### 2. **Smart Panel Selection**
Instead of taking every frame, it:
- Scores each subtitle based on story importance
- Ensures coverage of all story phases
- Maintains proper spacing between selected moments
- Targets 10-15 panels for optimal storytelling

### 3. **Adaptive Layout**
Based on panel count:
- **≤4 panels**: Single page, 2x2 grid
- **≤6 panels**: Single page, 2x3 grid  
- **≤9 panels**: Single page, 3x3 grid
- **≤12 panels**: Two pages, 2x3 grid each
- **>12 panels**: Multiple pages with varied layouts

## 📊 Example Story Extraction

**Input Video**: 10-minute dialogue with 200 subtitles

**Smart Extraction Results**:
1. Opening scene - "Hello, my name is..."
2. Character meeting - "Nice to meet you"
3. Problem introduction - "But there's a problem..."
4. First conflict - "We need to act fast!"
5. Action sequence - "Run! They're coming!"
6. Emotional moment - "I'm scared..."
7. Plan formation - "Here's what we'll do"
8. Climax buildup - "This is our only chance"
9. Peak action - "Now! Do it now!"
10. Resolution - "We did it!"
11. Emotional resolution - "I'm so happy"
12. Closing - "Thank you, goodbye"
