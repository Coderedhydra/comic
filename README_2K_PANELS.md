# 📐 2K Resolution Limit & Panel Export Feature

## 🎯 What's New

### 1. **2K Resolution Limit**
- All enhanced images are now capped at **2K resolution (2048x1080)**
- This applies to all AI models:
  - Real-ESRGAN
  - SwinIR  
  - Lightweight enhancers
  - Traditional upscaling
- Benefits:
  - Faster processing
  - Lower memory usage
  - More reasonable file sizes
  - Still high quality for web viewing

### 2. **Individual Panel Export (640x800)**
- After comic generation, all panels are automatically extracted
- Each panel is saved as a separate image file
- Fixed size: **640x800 pixels** (portrait orientation)
- Perfect for:
  - Social media posts
  - Mobile wallpapers
  - Print postcards
  - Digital collections

## 📁 Output Structure

After generating a comic, you'll find:

```
output/
├── page.html           # Full comic viewer
├── pages.json          # Comic data
├── smart_comic_viewer.html  # Smart comic (if enabled)
└── panels/             # NEW: Individual panels
    ├── panel_001_p1_1.jpg  # Panel 1 from page 1
    ├── panel_002_p1_2.jpg  # Panel 2 from page 1
    ├── panel_003_p2_1.jpg  # Panel 1 from page 2
    ├── ...
    └── panel_viewer.html   # Gallery view of all panels
```

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **During Enhancement**:
   - Images are enhanced using AI models
   - Resolution is capped at 2K (2048x1080)
   - Original aspect ratio is preserved

2. **During Panel Extraction**:
   - Each panel from the comic is extracted
   - Speech bubbles are rendered onto the panels
   - Images are resized to fit 640x800
   - White padding added if needed to maintain aspect ratio
   - Saved as high-quality JPEG (95% quality)

## 📸 Panel Features

- **Consistent Size**: All panels are exactly 640x800 pixels
- **Speech Bubbles Included**: Text is rendered directly on the image
- **High Quality**: JPEG compression at 95% quality
- **Numbered Naming**: Easy to identify which page/panel
- **White Background**: Clean presentation with padding

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### Resolution Changes:
```python
# Before: 4x upscaling (could reach 8K)
target_width = width * 4
target_height = height * 4

# Now: Max 2K with smart scaling
scale_factor = min(2048 / width, 1080 / height, 2.0)
target_width = int(width * scale_factor)
target_height = int(height * scale_factor)
```

### Panel Export:
```python
# Fixed panel dimensions
panel_size = (640, 800)  # Width x Height

# Maintains aspect ratio
# Adds white padding if needed
# Includes rendered speech bubbles
```

## 🎨 Example Results

**Input**: 1920x1080 video frame
**Enhanced**: 2048x1080 (2K limit applied)
**Panel Export**: 640x800 with speech bubbles

The system now provides both:
- Full comic pages for reading
- Individual panels for sharing

Perfect balance between quality and practicality!
