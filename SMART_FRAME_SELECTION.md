# âœ¨ Smart Frame Selection for Engaging Comics

## What It Does

When **Smart Frame Selection** is enabled (checkbox in UI), the system automatically selects the most engaging frames for your comic by:

1. **Analyzing each dialogue/subtitle** to understand the mood and context
2. **Scanning video frames** around each dialogue moment  
3. **Selecting frames where**:
   - The facial expression matches the dialogue mood
   - Eyes are fully open (no blinking or half-closed eyes)
   - The image is sharp and clear
   - The composition is visually appealing

## The Result

A comic that looks natural and engaging where:
- Characters look happy when saying happy things
- Characters look sad when saying sad things  
- No awkward frames with closed eyes
- Every panel is visually appealing

## How It Works (Internally)

The system uses multiple criteria to score each frame:

### 1. Expression Matching (Hidden from user)
- Analyzes dialogue sentiment
- Checks facial expressions
- Selects frames where they align

### 2. Eye Quality
- Detects eye state (open/closed)
- Strongly prefers open eyes
- Avoids blinks and half-closed eyes

### 3. Visual Quality
- Checks image sharpness
- Ensures good composition
- Avoids blurry frames

### 4. Engagement Score
Combines all factors to pick the BEST frame for each moment
