# 🎭 Emotion-Based Frame Selection

## How It Works (The RIGHT Way)

### Previous Approach (Wrong):
1. Extract random frames from video
2. Generate comic
3. THEN analyze emotions (too late!)
4. Just show emotion labels

### New Approach (Correct):
1. **Analyze dialogue emotions FIRST** 📝
2. **Search video for matching facial expressions** 🔍
3. **Select frames where face matches dialogue** ✅
4. **Create comic with perfect emotion matching** 🎭

## The Process

### Step 1: Emotion Analysis of Dialogue
```
Dialogue: "I'm so happy to see you!"
→ Detected emotion: HAPPY (85% confidence)
```

### Step 2: Video Scanning
For each dialogue, the system:
- Scans 2 seconds of video around that dialogue
- Analyzes facial expressions in multiple frames
- Checks eye state (avoiding closed eyes)
- Calculates emotion match scores

### Step 3: Smart Selection
```
Frame 1234: Happy face (90% match) + Open eyes ✅
Frame 1235: Neutral face (20% match) + Open eyes ❌
Frame 1236: Happy face (85% match) + Half-closed eyes ❌
Frame 1237: Happy face (88% match) + Open eyes ✅ ← Selected!
```

### Step 4: Result
A comic where:
- Happy dialogue → Happy facial expression
- Sad dialogue → Sad facial expression
- Angry dialogue → Angry facial expression
- And so on...

## Example Output
