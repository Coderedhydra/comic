# 🔧 Frame Generation Fix

## The Problem

From your output, I can see:
1. ✅ System correctly finds 89 subtitles
2. ✅ Selects 48 moments for full story  
3. ❌ BUT somewhere it reverts to 12 moments
4. ❌ Shows "0 frames" when generating pages
5. ❌ Tries to use "blank.png" which doesn't exist

## Root Cause

The pipeline is inconsistent:
- **Story extraction**: Selects 48 moments ✅
- **Keyframe generation**: Should extract 48 frames ❌
- **Bubble generation**: Filters back to 12 ❌
- **Page generation**: Finds 0 frames ❌

## What I've Fixed

### 1. Disabled Double Filtering
- Removed the second filtering in bubble generation
- Now uses the same 48 moments throughout

### 2. Ensured Consistent Frame Count
- Set `_filtered_count` to 48 for full story
- This count is used across all components

### 3. Better Logging
- Added logging to show frame generation status
- Shows how many files are in frames/final/

## What Should Happen Now

1. **Story Extraction**: 89 → 48 moments
2. **Frame Extraction**: 48 frames saved to frames/final/
3. **Enhancement**: All 48 frames enhanced
4. **Page Generation**: 12 pages × 4 panels = 48 panels
5. **Output**: Complete story comic

## Debugging Steps

If frames still aren't generated:

1. Check if frames/final/ directory exists and has files
2. Check if extract_frames function is working
3. Check if video path is correct
4. Check if ffmpeg/cv2 can read the video

## Expected Output After Fix

```
📖 Extracting complete story...
✅ Selected 48 evenly distributed moments
🎯 Generating keyframes...
✅ Generated 48 keyframes in frames/final/
📁 Frame files: 48 files in frames/final/
🎨 Enhancing quality and colors...
📄 Generating 12 pages with 2x2 grid
✅ Generated 12 pages with 48 total panels
```

The system should now generate all 48 frames properly!
