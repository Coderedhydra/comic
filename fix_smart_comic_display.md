# ðŸ”§ Smart Comic Display Fix

## The Issue
The smart comic viewer shows "no image displayed" because:
1. The HTML is looking for images at `/frames/final/{filename}`
2. The Flask routes need to serve these images properly
3. The smart comic generation might not have created the proper data structure

## The Solution

I've updated the smart comic viewer to:

### 1. **Fixed Image Paths**
- Changed from relative paths to proper Flask routes
- Added fallback image paths in case primary path fails
- Images now load from `/frames/final/` route

### 2. **Improved Layout**
- Created a 2-column grid layout for better visibility
- Added emotion badges showing text vs face emotions
- Added match scores and eye detection scores
- Shows summary statistics at the bottom

### 3. **Enhanced Features**
The smart comic now displays:
- **Match Score**: How well the facial expression matches the dialogue emotion (shown as percentage)
- **Eye Score**: Quality of eye detection (avoiding half-closed eyes)
- **Emotion Badges**: Shows detected emotions for both text and face
- **Color Coding**: 
  - Green = Good match (>70%)
  - Orange = Medium match (40-70%)
  - Red = Poor match (<40%)

## How It Works

When you generate a comic with smart mode enabled:

1. **Frame Selection**: 
   - Extracts multiple candidate frames per dialogue
   - Checks for open eyes (avoids blinking)
   - Selects best frame based on eye state

2. **Emotion Analysis**:
   - Analyzes dialogue text for emotions (happy, sad, angry, etc.)
   - Detects facial expressions in frames
   - Matches frames to dialogues based on emotion compatibility

3. **Smart Display**:
   - Shows selected panels with match scores
   - Highlights emotion detection results
   - Provides analytics on matching quality

## To Use

1. Upload your video with "Smart Mode" checkbox enabled
2. The system will:
   - Extract 48 frames avoiding closed eyes
   - Match emotions between text and faces
   - Generate the smart comic viewer
3. View at `/smart_comic` route

## Expected Results

You should see:
- Comic panels with clear, open-eyed characters
- Emotion labels showing text vs face emotions
- Match scores indicating quality of emotion matching
- Summary statistics showing overall performance

The smart comic provides a more intelligent comic generation that ensures:
- âœ… No half-closed eyes in panels
- âœ… Facial expressions match dialogue emotions
- âœ… Better storytelling through smart frame selection
